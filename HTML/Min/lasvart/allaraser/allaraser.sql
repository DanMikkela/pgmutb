Very agile and likes plenty of space, indoors or out.','Play and exercise are a vital part of daily routine.<br>Groom daily by rubbing with a gloved hand.','Although the Abyssinian is one of the oldest known breeds, there continues to be speculation and controversy concerning its history. In appearance, Abyssinians resemble the paintings and sculptures of ancient Egyptian cats which portray an elegant feline with a muscular body, beautiful arched neck, large ears and almond shaped eyes. Abys today still retain the jungle look of felis lybica, the African wildcat ancestor of all domestic cats.<p>The source of the name is not because Ethiopia, formerly Abyssinia, is thought to be the original home of these cats, but because the first "Abyssinian" exhibited at a show in England was reported to have been imported from that country. In the British book, by Gordon Staples,<cite>Cats, Their Points, Etc.</cite> published in 1874, there is the first mention of an Abyssinian. The book shows a coloured lithograph of a cat with a ticked coat and absence of tabby markings on the paws, face and neck. The description reads: "Zula, the property of Mrs. Captain Barrett-Lennard. This cat was brought from Abyssinia at the conclusion of the war." British troops left Abyssinia in May 1868, so that may have been the time when cats with ticked coats first entered England. Unfortunately, there are no written records tracing the early Abyssinians to those imported cats, and many British breeders are of the opinion that the breed was actually created through the crossing of the various existing silver and brown tabbies with native British "Bunny" ticked cats.<p>Recent studies by geneticists show that the most convincing origin of the Abyssinian breed is the coast of the Indian Ocean and parts of Southeast Asia. In fact, the earliest identifiable Aby is a taxidermal exhibit still residing in the Leiden Zoological Museum in Holland. This ruddy ticked cat was purchased around 1834-1836 from a supplier of small wild cat exhibits and labelled by the museum founder as "Patrie, domestica India." Although the Abyssinian as a breed was refined in England, its introduction to that country and others may have been the result of colonists and merchants stopping in Calcutta, the major port for the Indian Ocean.');

insert into rasbeskr values(3,'American Bobtail','americanbob.jpg','e','','','Anyone who has researched the American Bobtail already knows the story of "Yodie", the feral brown tabby kitten with a bobbed tail found on an Indian Reservation in Southern Arizona. That was back in the 1960s. And while bobtailed kittens had been around for generations, familiar to both early settlers and Native Americans, it was the adoption of Yodie and his subsequent breeding to a domestic Siamese that eventually lead to the drafting of the first breed standard for the American Bobtail.<p>Since the first written standard in 1970, outcrossing and simultaneous breeding throughout North America of feral, naturally short-tailed cats occurred, and the standard changed to include new colours and pattern variations. Having withstood rocky beginnings as a breed, the American Bobtail was accepted by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1989 as a New Breed. While recognition by other associations such as ACFA (American Cat Fanciers Association) and International Cat Exhibitors (ICE) has since transpired, the American Bobtail Breeders Association is currently aiming for status as a new breed with the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA). To that end, the American Bobtail was exhibited at the 1999 February Annual for CFA as an upcoming new breed.<p>On February 6th of 2000 the American Bobtail was recognized by the CFA at their semi-annual meeting in Houston as a new breed!<p>Paperwork and politics aside - let us talk about the actual cat.<p>Where the bobtail came from is not known. The decidedly wild appearance of the American Bobtail brown tabby, complete with cheek fuzz and ear tips, combined with feral beginnings, lends one to speculate about its origin and compare it to the wild bobcat or lynx. Yet DNA tests have been unsuccessful in providing any genetic link to these wild cats and the American Bobtail is considered to be a totally domestic creature, not a hybrid of any kind.<p>The length of the tail of the American Bobtail is a small yet still puzzling part of this cat. Whether it gets its naturally shortened tail from the same dominant gene which controls the Manx, the gene which endows the Japanese Bobtail, similar genetics that give the wild bobcat its shortened tail, or if it is a different gene factor altogether, has not yet been established. It is known that the gene produces variations of shortened tails, from no tails (rumpies) to stumpy tails (risers), to half length tails. Breeders of the American Bobtail are, in their ongoing development of the breed, gathering data in an attempt to identify some genetic pattern.<p>Aside from its shortened tail, its elongated rectangular and athletic body, its naturally large feet (the polydactyl gene which produces extra toes in a cat is not permitted in the American Bobtail standard), its cheeks which sport a familiar ruff , and its lynx tipped ears, the American Bobtail is a magnificent creature in personality as well. To watch a Bobtail, muscles rippling, spring into action after some prey (either imaginary or real) is thrilling and awe inspiring. But to then have this same creature, with all the prowess that Mother Nature has bestowed to enable it to survive the wild, crawl onto your lap and purr quietly is the icing on the cake!<p>When you watch a Bobtail walk, you will immediately notice that its hind quarters are slightly higher than its shoulders. This "jacked-up Chevy" look contributes to the American Bobtails hunting appearance. When you pick up a full grown male (who averages in the neighbourhood of 20 pounds) you will immediately be impressed with the muscle tone and strength that this cat possesses. And yet he will lean into you with his fuzzy cheeks and politely expect a rub.<p>The American Bobtail is a slow maturing breed, taking up to three years to satisfy its physical destiny. They are a low maintenance cat, with thick, double coats which are resilient both in the short haired or medium haired versions. The traditional brown tabby or the coloured lynx point are the most popular colour and pattern choices for those owners looking for a wild appearance.<p>The American Bobtail is a loyal and loving creature with above average intelligence. These easily trained cats have adaptable and warm personalities, are social with people, children and other pets. American Bobtail queens will readily adopt the kittens of another queen without fuss and rear them as their own. They have a distinctive vocabulary of chirps and yet are not a noisy or overly talkative cat. They learn their names, come when called and will run to greet you when you come through the door. A favourite game of the American Bobtail is fetch and while they are fun loving and frisky, they are neither overactive or destructive.<p>Since its humble and feral beginnings, the American Bobtail has developed to the point where todays breeders have multi generation pedigree stock and no longer require the use of feral cats, although outcrosses are still permissible with a natural short-tailed domestic cat of non-pedigree background.<p>Though not yet widely recognized, by continued development and nurturing by a dedicated group of breeders, the American Bobtail is well on its way to becoming a familiar and favourite breed!');

There are records that indicate several cats arrived on the "Mayflower." These first cats were brought along to hunt rats that ate the ships food supplies and spread diseases to humans. For centuries, these working cats flourished along with their pioneer owners and eventually established themselves as the native North American shorthaired cat. Over the years, these cats were further appreciated for their beauty and loving natures. One brown tabby American Shorthair, in 1896, commanded the price of $2500 at the Second Annual Cat Show at Madison Square Garden. Imagine what that sum of money would be in todays dollars!<p>With the introduction of foreign breeds to the United States during the early part of the 20th century, the naturally pure bloodlines of these "native" shorthairs began to be diluted. Longhairs and Siamese were being allowed to run free, resulting in kittens with a variety of coat lengths, body types, colours and temperaments. Those who admired the qualities of the native shorthaired cats and wished to preserve them acquired the finest examples of the American Shorthair and began to selectively breed them. These pioneer breeders worked to perfect the patterns and colours, while retaining the strong conformation, beautiful face and sweet disposition of the breed.');

It began as a spontaneous mutation in a litter of upstate New York farm cats in 1966. A spontaneous mutation is an uncommon, although not rare, happening. As it has occurred among cats in the past, two ordinary cats came together and as a result of their mating, a kitten unlike its parents or littermates was born. The progeny of the original mutation, Council Rock Farm Adams of Hi-Fi, are now in all areas of the United States. What is interesting and unusual about this particular mutation is that it has not been reported in any other country thus far.<p>The coat is the characteristic that separates the American Wirehair from all other breeds. Just as there is a wide variety of texture in Persians or Exotics, there is also considerable variation among the Wirehairs. As this is a dominant mutation, approximately half of the kittens will be wirehaired at birth. The most readily apparent wiring is that of the whiskers and ideally, the entire coat will be wired at birth. If the coat appears to be ringlets, it may be too long and may wave or straighten with maturity. Some of the lightly wired coats may continue to crimp during the early life of the Wirehair. The degree of coarseness depends upon the coat texture of the sire and dam. To produce the best wiring, both parents must have a hard coat.');

Some kittens start this spontaneously when very young; if you see this, you can encourage the little one by dangling a toy in front of the kitten. In any case, it seems to be a quite natural behaviour for some Chartreux and they retain this characteristic behaviour all their lives, frequently "begging" for food or affection by this praying attitude.<p>The Chartreux coat is short to medium in length, and ranges from ash to slate grey in colour. Plush and woolly in texture, it consists of down hairs close to the skin and longer guard hairs held up by kinkier support hairs. The hair starts out a light colour next to the skin and grows darker farther out; the silver tips give the cat a lovely iridescent sheen. The degree of wooliness depends on the age, sex, and habitat of the individual cat. Kittens may show some barring, or faint stripes, and some rings on the tail, which usually disappears by about two years of age. You can see from these two photographs the result of this mixture of hair types: the characteristic "breaking" or wool-like appearance.

No member of their family - adult, child, dog, turtle - is excluded from their sense of belonging.
<p>Since Colourpoints wear white or off-white coats, you will probably want to bathe your cat periodically to maintain its glistening "varnished" finish. Right after drying, you will have a fluffy-furred cat. Brush the coat with the concave side of a small rubber grooming brush to make the hair lie smoothly lustrous again. A weekly bath is not required, but regular nail-clipping should be routine. Colourpoints adore being groomed, so you can make an enthusiastic brushing the reward for tolerating a manicure! Tolerance is one of this breeds outstanding attributes. Though it seems contrary to their sensitivity, it is just not in their earnest loving nature to be otherwise. Heed the instructions of your cats breeder when you acquire your Colourpoint, and you will be blessed with long-lived, joyous companionship.');

The new cats were bred together, and the new breed held true.<p>The Cymrics predecessor, the Mans, is itself a genetic mutation first discovered on the Isle of Man, off the west coast of England. The length of the tail, which is totally absent in the breed standard (referred to as "Rumpy"), actually can vary quite widely and in some individuals is only a bit shorter than normal cat tails. Some individuals have a remnant tail and these are dubbed "Stumpies," while those which have nearly full tails are called "Longies."<p>Some theories suggest that the Manx, and subsequently the Cymric, are actually the descendants of the Japanese Bobtail or a related breed that was somehow transported to this distant island half a world from its native land in the Far East. Other tales tell of invaders that nipped the tails from the cats as a sort of victory symbol and of queens that habitually bit the tails from their offspring.<p>Cymrics are affectionate, intelligent cats, happiest when they are doing something. They have good amusing ability and enjoy time outdoors, but they are very comfortable in the home as well. They get along well with other animals, including dogs.<p>All colours and patterns are acceptable in the Cymric, which has a medium to long coat with a thick undercoat and shiny, smooth top hairs. The body has a stocky, muscular build. In the true breed standard the end of the thumb should fit into the hollow that marks the spot where the tail should start. The overall body generally has an arched appearance, due to shorter than normal vertebrae.<p>The legs are short and thick, with the hind legs longer than the forelegs. The paws are round and large. The head is round, with a short nose, strong chin, large, round eyes, and medium ears that are rounded at the tips.<p>The coat requires regular brushing, but it is easily groomed and very rarely mars.<p>Because the bodily features that give the breed its distinction are essentially genetic defects, the Cymric is a controversial breed.

They lie in stacks like untidy cordwood in front of heat vents or pile one upon another until they lie six deep in a cat bed designed for one or two. They MAY sit upon a window sill but only to chatter excitedly at squirrels or other passers by.<p>Devons never meander, they favour a purposeful trot. They know WHERE they are going and WHAT they are going to do when they get there.

A quick shampoo, rinse, towel pat and hang over the shoulder to dry or place in a sunny window.

It is soft in texture, but each cats coat is distinctly unique.<p>Some kittens are born hairless, but most have short, wavy hair at birth. Often, the tops of their heads will be bald during the first four months or so. They can also be born with wavy hair and then lose it. For the first six months, its pretty much a guessing game.<p>The breed is "low maintenance", requiring minimum grooming because the coat does not easily mat. LaPerms curls hold the hair, much like that of the Poodle, so shedding is minimal. Bath and towel drying is all that is required to maintain the curl. Blow drying tends to make the hair frizz. After the coat is totally dry, spraying with a fine mist of plain water works well to achieve even more curl.<p>The coat on both the short and long-haired varieties may vary in length and fullness depending upon the season and the maturity of the cat. Both males and females have a full ruff on the neck at maturity. The face and head of the LaPerm are triangular in shape with wide-set ears and large, expressive eyes. They even boast a splendid set of curly whiskers. Their legs are elongated in proportion to their small-to-medium-sized bodies. Males tend to weigh about 7-12 pounds while females grow to be 5 to 6 pounds. Although the look of each kitten varies, one thing always remains the same: the great personality of this new breed.

This makes breeding difficult in that producing a silver Persian with the same head type and ears as most of the other colour varieties is not easy. Persians are divided by colour and then separated again into divisions into which most of the colours appear. The divisions incorporate the solid, shaded silvers, shaded goldens, cameos, and chinchillas. Also seen are smokes and tabby tortoiseshell and particolour or bicolour. There are also shaded versions of the solid colours. Eyes must be copper with the exception of the silvers that have a blue green eye colour and the goldens have green to hazel eyes. The Himalayan is the newest division in most cat associations. The Persian cats that are lilac point, blue point. chocolate point, seal point, red point, tortie point and lynx point are considered Himalayan. These all must have blue eyes.<p>The Persian cat is a very lovable animal who is calm, and gentle. He loves to be petted and shown a lot of attention. But Persian also can take care of itself without too much entertaining by humans.');

The coat length varies slightly but in general it is low-maintenance compared to that of other longhaired breeds. They also tend to be soft-pawed, meaning that they almost never put out their claws.

As they get older, the curly whiskers that are so cute on a kitten can become brittle and break off - leaving them with whiskers that are barely there.<p>Maintaining the curl and coat is the same as with any longhair cat - combing and brushing before bathing. However, too much combing and brushing after the bath will straighten the hairs and the curl is not as obvious. Shampoos that do not coat the hair but leave it silky and clean are the best to allow the hairs to curl.<p>Currently there are not many curly pets available - most curly cats, especially females, are in breeding programs.

Although the variant did not re-occur, Dorothy liked the contrast between the point colour and the stark white of the feet and developed the first Snowshoe line by crossing her Siamese with a bicolour American Shorthair. Continued breeding eventually produced the popular "V" face of the current Snowshoe in addition to the mitted variety.<p>The American Cat Association (ACA) accepted the Snowshoe for registration in 1974. At about the same time, Cat Fanciers Federation (CFF) recognized the Snowshoe as an experimental breed. Between 1960 and 1977, interest in the breed had lagged, and in 1977, when Jim Hoffman and Georgia Kuhnell wrote to CFF for information on the breed, CFF referred them to Vikki Olander who was the only breeder of Snowshoes registered with CFF. Since then, interest in the breed has continued to grow. CFF advanced the Snowshoe to Championship status at their semi-annual meeting in September 1982. The American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA) both recognize the Snowshoes as champions.

They have a fine, elegant boning, are loving and friendly, active, intelligent, very curious, and even enjoy playing in water. They seem to bond with each other in a way that is not common among our domestic kitties. They also come in a "White Tabby" or "Snow Sokoke". This colour seems to have been introduced when Jeni, concerned about their close inbreeding, introduced a black local feral cat to the gene pool.<p> The original work with this breed was done in Denmark, where Gloria Moeldrup (a friend of Jenis) took the first Sokokes from Kenya. Gloria and about 6 other breeders formed the Sokoke Council and are still active today trying to save these very special kitties. In 1998, through a friendship build on the internet, Judy Allen and Sherri Parks brought the first Sokoke, a female named Kwaza, to America in exchange for a pair of Bengals (the first in Denmark).
