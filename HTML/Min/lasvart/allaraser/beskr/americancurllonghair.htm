Are their ears always like that? Did you use a curling iron?"<p>Yes, their ears ARE always like that and no, a curling iron was NOT used to achieve those extraordinary ears! The curled ear is a natural genetic mutation and first time admirers are always surprised by the American Curls unique ears and impressed by their overall striking beauty. Curls quickly become a favourite with all who come to know them.<p>The American Curls ears, which are firm to the touch and curl back in a graceful arc away from their face toward the center back of their head, are a genetic mutation given to us by none other than Mother Nature. Discovered in California as a stray cat in 1981, the American Curl is now recognized as one of the United States native American cat breeds.<p>The Curls temperament is one of curiosity and companionship. Being very people-oriented, they like to assist in all household projects and delight in "bumping heads" with their owners or new human acquaintances. Curls are even tempered and intelligent, yet they retain their kitten-type behaviour throughout their adult life. Not overly talkative, the Curls will tell you when they need something or desire attention. American Curls easily adapt to almost any home situation and adjust to other animals remarkably well. Simply stated, they are extremely affectionate and absolutely ear-resistible!</font></td></tr><tr><td width=100%><center>
