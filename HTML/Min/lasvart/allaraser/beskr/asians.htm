Simply stated, they are extremely affectionate and absolutely ear-resistible!<p>The Asian Group comprises the Shadeds, Smokes, Selfs and Tabbies (all separate breeds) including the Bombay, Burmilla and Tiffanie.<p>The Asian cats are of medium build and resemble closely their ancestors the Burmese. In the Asians the female is much smaller and daintier than the male. The head has good width between the ears and a gently rounded dome. The jaw is wide at the hinge tapering to a broad blunt muzzle. In profile the head forms a short wedge with a firm chin and short nose. The chin and the tip of the nose are in the same vertical plane. The ears are of medium size with a rounded tip. They are set so as to continue the angle of the face and are slightly tilted forward. The eyes are set well apart and are full and expressive. The eyes may be any colour from yellow through to green depending on the variety. The body is firm and muscular with a strong straight back. The legs are of medium length and the hind legs are a little longer than the front. The paws are oval and the tail is medium to long tapering slightly to a rounded tip.<p>The Asian is very like the Burmese in temperament - extremely friendly and affectionate - but slightly less boisterous than the Burmese. They love attention and need to be part of the family. They can be quite demanding and often follow their owners around the house crying for attention. If spoken to they often appear to understand and answer. Asians are very intelligent and can often work out such problems as how to open doors. The curiosity and friendliness of the Asian can often lead it to stray into visitors cars or delivery vans and they may be best confined to the house or a secure garden. They usually settle quite happily to this arrangement, as above all they do love their home comforts. They love to play and toys and scratching post should be provided for amusement as well as quality time set aside for play with their humans. They can be very sensitive to their owners feelings and this makes them excellent companions. They are generally good with children and when fed up with the rough and tumble of play with human children will stalk off until peace resumes.</font></td></tr><tr><td width=100%><center>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
