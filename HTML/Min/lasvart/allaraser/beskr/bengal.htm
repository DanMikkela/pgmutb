Subsequent breeding of the generations into other bengals or domestics are called F2, F3 and finally SBT or Standard Bred Tabby, Bengal. SBT is the first generation that can be seen at Cat Shows.<p>Bengals are very loyal, affectionate and loving pets, they purr and meow as do the more domestic breeds. They are exceedingly intelligent due to their more recent decent from the jungles of Asia. They love to climb, jump and play in water, they will happily streak through the shower or join you in the tub. The SBT Bengal exhibits the mystery and prowess of a jungle cat in appearance with the loving playful and gentle nature it shares with all domesticated cats.<p>Bengals train more like dogs and quickly learn parlour tricks normally associated with canines and not cats. Bengals love to fetch, will roll over, will high five you and learn quickly to walk on a harness/collar and leash. Their learning is only limited, by what you want to teach them.<p>Being fearless they love outings in the car and are great vacation companions. They interact well with other animals, unrelated cats, dogs, ferrets, and even horses. They are adoring pets of children and quickly adapt to seniors. They have the same requirements for housing, potty box equipment, inoculations and food (as long its high protein formulated).<p>Bengals seldom get the aloof attitude associated with many adult cats, when you are ready to play, they are good to go. However, shy and fearful Bengal cats or kittens are very apt to remain that way and do not generally change even with the most loving care- giver. Bengals must be handled and socialized as very young kittens, so it is suggested that verifiable references are a necessity whether buying in person or on-line.<p>Bengals come in a variety of colours and in two patterns of markings. First is the Spotted pattern, from small spots spread thickly over the body to large and often rosetted spots with large unspotted areas between them (referred to as acreage).<p>Look for tons of contrast between the base colour and the spots. There are four different colour variations, Brown Spotted, Seal Sepia Spotted, Seal Mink Spotted and a Seal Lynx Point Spotted. In all colours and patterns allow for kitten fuzzes that tend to hide or mute the coat, this will pass and is natures way of hiding the very young. The Seal Lynx Point kitten will be almost totally white.<p>The marbled pattern occurs no where else in nature, while called a Brown Marbled, look for the tricolour marbled kitten. Patterns should be symmetrical on both sides of the body and the pattern should swirl and flow around the body, like the colours in a glass marble. No bulls eye pattern on the sides is best. You can literally find yourself "waiting to exhale" so awesome is the beauty in this pelt pattern. Marbled Bengals also come in all three snow variations, the Seal Sepia, the Seal Mink and the Seal Lynx Point who also sports deep blue eyes.<p>All Bengals except the Seal Lynx Point Snow must have a black tipped tail and black paw pads. The Seal Lynx Point has a bitter chocolate coloured tail tip and can have a rose tinted nose and paw pads. Marbled kittens start with blackish grey coats with small streaks of lighter coloured fur scattered about their coat. Your breeder can advise you on marking potential.<p>New breed colours being shown now, but not yet excepted in the Standard, include the Blue and the Silver, both come Spotted or Marbled patterns, both are incredible in appearance.<p>Whether you are lucky enough to "own" a "show quality" Bengal or a "pet quality" Bengal, you find that once owned by them, no other cat will ever quite do!</font></td></tr><tr><td width=100%><center>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
