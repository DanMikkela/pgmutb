They are excellent house cats and are highly affectionate. The foundation cats used to create the breed were one half Burmese, and quarter each Abyssinian and Domestic.<p>They have inherited the affectionate, people-loving temperament, general size and shape of the Burmese, the intelligence and agility of the Abyssinian, and the health and vitality of the Domestic. Australian Mist are short-haired cats of moderate size and build. They have a round head and large, expressive eyes in a range of greens.<p>The nose, chin and whisker pads are broad, giving the face a generous expression. There are two possible coat patterns in the Australian Mist: Spotted and Marbled. These delicate spots or intricate marbled swirls are set against a creamy misted ground, with legs ringed and barred and the face and neck delicately lined.<p>The spotted mist tail is also ringed while the marbled mist tail has beautiful irregular scalloping. The cats coat is short and resilient and the tail is well furred. Australian Mist cats presently come in six colours: warm brown, blue, chocolate, lilac, gold and peach. Australian Mists are outstandingly affectionate and gentle. They are very tolerant of handling and disinclined to scratch, which makes them ideal with even small children. Australian Mist are highly intelligent and are very obliging when called upon to participate in games.<p>As kittens they are lively, but sober up somewhat on maturity. Their propensity to crawl into the nearest lap with or without invitation, and to constantly hang around to see what people are up to makes them an excellent companion for the home worker, and the invalid. Neutered cats and kittens fit in easily with all sorts of other cats, being neither aggressive toward them, nor allowing themselves to be upset by the unfriendliness of others. They are perfectly happy to live wholly indoors as long as they have a few toys to play with and plenty of human company or the company of another cat.</font></td></tr><tr><td width=100%><center>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
