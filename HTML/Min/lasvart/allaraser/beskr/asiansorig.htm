      <p><font size=2 face=Verdana>Asian cats are a variation of the Burmese breed 
        and are very similar in temprement, looks, and personality. <BR>
        Athletic, Intelligent, and Friendly, &quot;Asian Selfs&quot; are basically 
        Burmese but with stronger coat colours. <BR>
        d adjust to other animals remarkably well. Simply stated, they are extremely 
        affectionate and absolutely ear-resistible!<br><br>
        The Asian Group comprises the Shadeds, Smokes, Selfs and Tabbies (all 
        separate breeds) including the Bombay, Burmilla and Tiffanie.<br><br>
		The Asian cats are of medium build and resemble closely their ancestors the Burmese.
	    In the Asians the female is much smaller and daintier than the male. The head has good 
		width between the ears and a gently rounded dome. The jaw is wide at the hinge tapering
		to a broad blunt muzzle. In profile the head forms a short wedge with a firm chin and
	    short nose. The chin and the tip of the nose are in the same vertical plane. The ears 
	    are of medium size with a rounded tip. They are set so as to continue the angle of the
		face and are slightly tilted forward. The eyes are set well apart and are full and expressive.
		The eyes may be any colour from yellow through to green depending on the variety.
		The body is firm and muscular with a strong straight back. The legs are of medium length
		and the hind legs are a little longer than the front. The paws are oval and the tail is 
		medium to long tapering slightly to a rounded tip.<br><br>
		The Asian is very like the Burmese in temperament - extremely friendly and affectionate - 
		but slightly less boisterous than the Burmese. They love attention and need to be part of 
		the family. They can be quite demanding and often follow their owners around the house 
		crying for attention. If spoken to they often appear to understand and answer. Asians are 
		very intelligent and can often work out such problems as how to open doors. The curiosity 
		and friendliness of the Asian can often lead it to stray into visitor's cars or delivery 
		vans and they may be best confined to the house or a secure garden. They usually settle 
		quite happily to this arrangement, as above all they do love their home comforts. They 
		love to play and toys and scratching post should be provided for amusement as well as 
		quality time set aside for play with their humans. They can be very sensitive to their 
		owner's feelings and this makes them excellent companions. They are generally good with 
		children and when fed up with the rough and tumble of play with human children will stalk 
		off until peace resumes.</font>
