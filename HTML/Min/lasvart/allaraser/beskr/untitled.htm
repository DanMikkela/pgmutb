It has many of the best qualities of both. The breeder of the Tonkinese thought the show Siamese were becoming too extreme. She tried to create a cat with qualities she liked best in both the Siamese and Burmese breeds. A pet shop owner in the U.S. has the same goal and called his cats Golden Siamese. The Canadian cat took this name but then changed it to Tonkinese. In the mid 1960s the Canadian Cat Association recognized this cat as a championship competitor. The United States granted recognition in 1972. In Britain the Tonkinese is only recognized by one cat association.<p>This is a medium sized cat shaped between the Burmese and the Siamese. He is muscular and firm. The legs are slender and in proportion to its body. The Tonkinese eyes are aquamarine to turquoise in colour, a distinct feature of this cat. They came about due to the crossing of the Blue eyed Siamese and the golden eyed Burmese. The Tonkinese has a luxurious coat which in medium short. It is fine and like silk. Grooming entails a combing on occasion to remove dead hair. This breed should also live in a warm climate<p>For championship show only five colours are allowed. They are blue mink, champagne mink, honey mink, natural mink, and platinum mink. There are some groups that will allow colours like the pointed Siamese or Burmese.<p>The Tonkinese exhibits lively behaviour and is very lovable. His strong personality has the Siamese curiosity. Consider having two cats if you are often gone as this breed does not like to be alone and can get into trouble if lonely. The Tonkinese is also an escape artist and will find ways to get out of the house. This breed is healthy and lives a long life.</font></td></tr><tr><td width=100%><center>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table><P><A href="mailto:info@miomi.se" style="color:#000000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;">WebDesign</A>&nbsp;
