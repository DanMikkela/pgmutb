Irregularly fluid linear markings that are interwoven and branching,
as the stripes on a tiger. Characteristic of some tabby markings found
on the Toyger. <br>
<h4>BREAK:</h4>
<p></p>
An indentation of the nose at about eye level or between the eyes. <br>
<h4>BRINDLE:</h4>
<p></p>
(Brindles, brindling) A blending of two colors, as in many
tortoiseshell cats. The scattered "wrong" colored hairs in a coat. <br>
<h4>BRITCHES:</h4>

<h4>BRUSH COAT:</h4>
<p></p>
May either be a full dense coat with short, slightly wiry curly
hairs, or sparsely scattered short, slightly wiry curly hairs covering
the entire body. <br>
<h4>COAT COMPOSITION:</h4>
<p></p>
There are three main types of hair that makeup the normal coat: 1)
guard hairs, 2) bristle or awn hairs, and 3) down or wool hairs. <br>
<h4>COBBY:</h4>
<p></p>
Having a short, compact body, with broad shoulders and rump. Usually
goes along with a short tail and a large, rounded head, as in the
Persian, Himalayan, Exotic Shorthair, or Manx/Cymric. <br>
<h4>COMPACT:</h4>
<p></p>
Closely or neatly packed together opposite of rangy. <br>
<h4>CONCAVE:</h4>
<p></p>
Curve shaped like the inside arc of a circle. <br>
<h4>CONDITION:</h4>
<p></p>
Referring to the state of being of the cat, i.e., health, both
mental and physical. Proper weight, overall health and grooming are
considerations. <br>
<h4>CONFORMATION:</h4>
<p></p>
The particular form of a cat, made up of the size and shape of a
breed. Also called type. <br>
<h4>CONTRAST:</h4>
<p></p>
The visibly noticeable difference in color and value between two
coat colors on a cat. <br>
<h4>CONVEX:</h4>
<p></p>
Curve shaped like the outside arc of a circle. <br>
<h4>COWHOCKING:</h4>
<p></p>
Condition in which a cat has back legs which are not parallel, the
hocks are very close together. <br>
<h4>CRISP:</h4>
<p></p>
Firm, not soft or limp. Refers to British Shorthair coat texture. <br>
<h4>CROUP:</h4>

<p></p>
Heavy undercoat, thick, hairs are crowded together. <br>
<h4>DEPTH OF FLANK:</h4>
<p></p>
Determined by viewing the flank from top to bottom; the area between
the rib cage and the thigh. The Manx/Cymric will have greater depth of
flank; the Cornish Rex will have minimal depth of flank. <br>
<h4>DOMED:</h4>
<p></p>
Hemispherical or rounded. <br>

Upright large ears set close together. <br>
<h4>DOUBLE COAT:</h4>
<p></p>
Having a thick undercoat with another top coat of longer hairs. The
awn hairs may be the same length as the guard hairs (Russian Blues, for
example) or there may be longer guard hairs (as in the Manx). <br>
<h4>DOWN HAIRS:</h4>
<p></p>
Soft, crimped, secondary hairs. <br>
<h4>EAR MUFFS:</h4>
<p></p>
Longer fur on the lower back side of the ear in Devon Rex, also

<p></p>
Effect created by knotted/fused vertebrae and fur of the Japanese
Bobtail. <br>
<h4>FLANK: </h4>
<p></p>
The part between the ribs and thigh at either side of the body. <br>
<h4>FLARED:</h4>
<p></p>
Spread out. <br>
<h4>FOLDED EARS:</h4>

The ears fold downward toward the face. This is a dominant gene
affecting the cartilage. <br>
<h4>FOREIGN TYPE:</h4>
<p></p>
Modified wedge or wedge shaped head, large ears, oval or almond
shaped eyes, long body with legs in proportion to body length, slim,
fine boned, long and tapering tail. Elegant. Greater depth of flank
than in Oriental type. The Abyssinian and Russian Blue are examples of
Foreign type. <br>
<h4>FORESHORTENED:</h4>
<p></p>
Shorter than normal; usually due to the fusion of vertebrae of the
spine in the lumbar and spinal area of the cat (back and tail). This is
sometimes seen and felt in Scottish Folds where flexibility is reduced
and thickness is increased. <br>
<h4>FROSTED:</h4>
<p></p>
Suggestion of light ends to the hair shaft, which give a frosted or
silvered appearance; also used in reference to reverse ticking. <br>

Long coarser hairs forming the outer coat; the longer outer hairs. <br>
<h4>GYPSY SHAG:</h4>
<p></p>
Loose and bouncy hair of different lengths (layered). Appearance of
permanent losing it's tight curl. Semi long hair loosely curled at
varying lengths, rather than all one length, as in the LaPerm. In
comparison a Selkirk would have a tight "Afro", Devon and Cornish would
appear "Marcelled", or finger-waved. <br>
<h4>HAIRLESSNESS:</h4>
<p></p>
Relative absence of noticeable coat. Hairlessness is not usually
absolute in the cat; there may be hair on the points of a Sphynx and
the body is often covered with a down similar to suede. <br>

<p></p>
The joint of the hind leg corresponding to the ankle in man. The
joint between the knee and the top of the foot. <br>

in the center of the ear above the canal (as in the AC ear). <br>
<h4>LACES:</h4>
<p></p>
Linear patterns of white extending up from the feet, especially the
back feet. <br>
<h4>LOCKET:</h4>
<p></p>
An undesirable small spot of white usually found in the neck, groin,

Denoting the type of some breeds, use to indicate longer length of
body that is not accompanied by foreign type. <br>

<p></p>
A variation of the tabby pattern whereby doughnut or floral shapes
instead of spots are formed. <br>
<h4>RUFOUS:</h4>
<p></p>
Refers to a reddening of the coat color, especially the ground color
in brown tabbies. May be a polygene or the result of the action of a
group of polygenes. Considered desirable in the Golden. The rufous

<h4>TICKED:</h4>
<p></p>
Three or four separate bands of color on each hair shaft, as on the
Abyssinian. <br>
<h4>TIPPING:</h4>
<p></p>
Having colored ends of the hairs, with a different color on the
lower portion of the hair shaft. In silvers the degree of tipping can
decide whether a cat is classified as a chinchilla, shaded or smoke. <br>
<h4>TORSO:</h4>
<p></p>
The trunk of the body. <br>
<h4>TRIPLE COAT:</h4>
<p></p>
The awn, down and guard hairs are all the same length. <br>
<h4>TUBULAR:</h4>
<p></p>
Cylindrical, shaped like a tube. Having the same circumference at
any point along its length. <br>
<h4>TUCK UP:</h4>
<p></p>
Curved spine creates the drawing in of the flank, as in a Greyhound
or the Cornish Rex, the opposite of increased depth of flank as in the
Manx.. <br>
<h4>TUFTS:</h4>
<p></p>
Clusters of hair growing close together as between the toes or
behind the ears. <br>
<h4>TYPE:</h4>
<p></p>
Conformation, the general form, structure. <br>

<p></p>
A true undercoat is the wooly or down hairs, under the longer guard
hairs.
<h4>UNDERCOLOR:</h4>
<p></p>
The part of the hair shaft closest to the skin, in a smoke, the
non-pigmented portion of the hair shaft, in tabbies, the ground color.
<h4>UNDERSHOT:</h4>
<p></p>
The lower jaw protrudes out in front of the upper jaw.
<h4>VERTICAL CRIMP:</h4>
<p></p>
Beginning at the base of the ear and continuing along some or all of
its height, the outer edge of the ear bends or rolls vertically in
toward the center of the ear giving the outer edge of the ear a pinched
or crimped aspect (as in the AC ear).
<h4>WALNUT:</h4>
<p></p>
Having a rounded shape of a walnut; a slightly flattened circle; not
quite an oval. Used to describe eye shape.
<h4>WEDGE:</h4>
(As viewed from the top of front) is created by straight lines from
outer ear bases along sides of muzzle, without a break in the jaw line
at the whiskers. Skull to be flat and the straight nose a continuation
of the forehead.
<h4>WHIPPY:</h4>
